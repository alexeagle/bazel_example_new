# Users can import using workspace paths, for example in tsickle we can
#  import {} from 'tsickle/some/deep/import'
# and it's essential that the first path segment here matches the name on NPM, so that
# these deep-imports work for users.
# Remember that users will just have standard node module resolution, yet these imports
# will be written by TypeScript without any translation.

# However, this is a problem for scoped packages. Also, it abuses the Bazel convention
# of namespacing by urls.
# Here's a proposal to encode arbitrary npm package names in Bazel:
# this is URI-encoding of com_npmjs:@bazel/example_new with %->__
workspace(name = "com_npmjs__3A__40bazel__2Fexample_new") 
# That would require that we map the workspace name whenever we use it for node resolution.
# Within this repo I should be able to `import {} from '@bazel/example_new'` without any
# special path mapping or module_name on a rule.

## Bootstrapping bit to get nodejs rules
# Users will have to paste this into their WORKSPACE file to get started,
# but after that we can manage the WORKSPACE file for them.
